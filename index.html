                 <p>My hobby is art. Art helps people express their emotions. Every artwork communicates something to the observer. Art surrounds life, all people in every location, without us being aware of it. It forms our culture and may be different then what you think. Most people think of art as something that you make with your hands to observe. What people dont know is that it is also includes dancing, singing, and so much more. Art builds up a society and what makes it unique. The creativity of the world is crucial, but we wouldn't have it without art. Thinking of when humans first started, they actually did art as in making their own clothes. Art is so expressive and can change your life in many ways. It gives you hand skills and the crucial skill of creativity which brings us curiosity. Without creativity there is no individuality, which would make life one color and boring.</p>
